      </header>
    <p>Computers have become an essential part of modern society, impacting education, healthcare, business, and governance. Understanding the basic components, software, and their implementation in institutions helps communities leverage technology effectively. This presentation focuses on computer hardware, software types, and their practical application in different institutions within the community (Morley & Parker, 2012; Sommerville, 2011).</p>

      <h1>What is Computer Hardware?</h1>

      <div class="slide1txt">
    <p>Computer hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system that perform computing tasks. These include the central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage devices, and input/output devices, which collectively enable a computer to operate efficiently. Hardware forms the foundation of any computing system and is essential for executing software applications (Tanenbaum & Austin, 2012; Stallings, 2016).</p>

      <p>Computer hardware consists of several key components that work together to perform computing tasks. Each type of hardware has a specific role, and together they ensure smooth system operation (Hennessy & Patterson, 2011; Petzold, 2000).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Input Devices: Keyboard, mouse, scanner – allow user interaction</li>

      <h1>Analysis</h1>
      <div class="analysis">

    <div class="p1">
      <h3>Understanding Hardware and Software</h3>
      <p>Learning about computer hardware, software, and how they are used in institutions has shown me how important technology is in everyday life. Hardware and software are connected and cannot work well without each other. Hardware includes things we can touch, like computers, phones, or projectors. Software is the set of programs that make these devices useful. For example, without software, a computer is just a box of parts. Together, they create tools that help people work, learn, and communicate.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="p2">
  <h3>Technology in Education</h3>
  <p>In schools, technology has changed the way students and teachers interact. Hardware such as laptops, tablets, and smartboards, combined with software like online classrooms and learning apps, make lessons more interactive and fun. Students from different places can now access the same resources, which helps reduce the gap between those in cities and those in rural areas.</p>
  <p>However, these benefits only happen if schools have enough money to buy devices and if teachers know how to use them well. Without training and support, technology can become more of a problem than a solution.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="p2">
  <h3>Technology in Healthcare</h3>
  <p>Hospitals also show how powerful technology can be. Machines such as scanners, monitors, and lab equipment provide doctors with important information about patients. Software programs are used to keep medical records, track treatments, and even suggest possible diagnoses.</p>
  <p>This helps doctors and nurses work more quickly and accurately, which can save lives. But just like in schools, hospitals face challenges. Technology is often very expensive, and staff need regular training to use new systems effectively. If these challenges are not solved, the benefits of technology may not be fully achieved.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="p3">
  <h3>The Human Factor</h3>
  <p>From these examples, I understand that the hardest part of using technology is not the machines or the programs, but the people who use them. Some people resist change, while others may not have the right training. Institutions that succeed with technology are those that see it as more than just equipment. They invest in people, provide training, and create a culture that supports change.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="p4">
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>In my opinion, hardware and software are not only technical tools but also forces that can improve lives. They can make education fairer, healthcare better, and communities stronger. The real challenge is making sure everyone has access to these opportunities. If institutions continue to invest wisely and support their people, technology can become a bridge that connects and empowers communities everywhere.</p>

  <p>Hello! I’m a first-year IT student from Block A with a strong interest in programming and web development. This portfolio was originally assigned as a PowerPoint presentation, but I decided to create a website instead so I could practice my skills in HTML and CSS. Building it gave me the chance to apply what I’ve been learning while also showcasing my work in a more interactive way. I enjoy challenging myself with new projects like this and look forward to growing as a developer.</p>
